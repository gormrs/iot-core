## IOT CORE DEVELOPER TEST


## Instructions:
You will have to define the terms in which you understand the assignment. There are no definitive answers
to the case. If you have any doubts, make the reservations and assumptions which are necessary. We do
not expect you to deliver the definitive answer to all aspects of the case, but more to see your approach
and how you write your code (Maintainability, easy to read/understand and performance)

## Case
Objective
As a user of buses in Finland I want to be able to consume data for my mobile app that shows where each
bus is. I want to be able to search for buses close to me and show what their next stop is. If you come up
with other cases that I can use the data that could enhance my possibilities in the app, please add them as
well.

## Write a service in your preferred language that:
* Consumes telemetry from the MQTT server mqtt.hsl.fi
* Stores the telemetry
* Makes the telemetry searchable in a sane way through an API (http/gRPC/SignalR)
* Optional: Infrastructure needed to run the service (if any) should be hosted in docker
